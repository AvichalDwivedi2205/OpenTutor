# Updates Summary

## Issues Fixed and Features Added

### 1. ✅ Fixed Hydration Error
**Problem**: Server-client mismatch due to date formatting differences

2. **File Upload**: Implement actual file upload functionality for roadmap creation
3. **AI Integration**: Connect roadmap generation to AI service
4. **Topic Learning**: Build individual topic learning pages
5. **Progress Tracking**: Implement real progress tracking and completion logic
6. **Authentication**: Integrate with Clerk for user-specific data

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing design patterns.
